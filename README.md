Lazarus is a grid of sensors that are designed to be placed across large expanses of Quebec's boreal forest. This is to notify the emergency services of when a lightning strike has occurred so they can act, in case of a wildfire. It works through a series of sensors that all communicate with a central server. When it detects a strike, this server sends out an alert to the fire department and displays the strike's location on a website so the firefighters know where to go.

This project was completed as the extension for our ICL first-year C project.
